Meetings are typically held on a monthly basis during the school year, often on the second Wednesday evening of each month, though dates can be subject to change. They are usually held at the Chicopee City Hall Auditorium. You can find meeting notices and agendas on the city's calendar or the Chicopee Public Schools website. Some meetings may also offer a virtual (Zoom) participation option.\n*   **Chicopee City Council Meetings:** These meetings are held on the first and third Tuesday of every month, except for July and August when they meet only on the first Tuesday. They occur at the City Council Chambers, 4th floor, City Hall Annex, immediately following the Mayor's Briefing which begins at 6:30 PM. Attending these meetings will allow you to understand broader city issues and connect with residents interested in local government.\n*   **Other City Commission and Committee Meetings:** The city calendar lists various other meetings such as the Ambulance Commission, Housing Authority Board, Board of Assessors, and Water Resources Committee. Attending these can show your engagement with different aspects of city governance and community well-being.\n*   **Chicopee Public Library Events:** The library often hosts various community activities, including \"Genealogy Open Lab\" and \"Tech Goes Home\" courses. Their social media also serves as a limited public forum.\n\n**Recurring Community Events:**\n\n*   **Chicopee Center Fresh Farmers Market:** This market runs weekly on Thursdays from 1 PM to 6 PM, from June through October, at Lucy Wisniowski Park (32 Chestnut St, Chicopee). It features vendors selling vegetables, agricultural products, prepared foods, and crafts, and is a great place to meet a diverse group of residents.\n*   **Summer Band Concerts:** The Chicopee Parks & Recreation Department often hosts summer band concerts at the Aldenville Commons. For example, in 2025, there are concerts scheduled on various Tuesdays and Wednesdays in July and August.\n\n**Annual and Seasonal Events (based on past occurrences and 2025 projections):**\n\n*   **Memorial Day Parade:** Chicopee holds an annual Memorial Day Parade to honor fallen veterans.\n*   **Chicopee Patriotic Parade and Fireworks:** The city has hosted an annual Patriotic Parade followed by a fireworks display, typically in late June. The fireworks for 2025 are scheduled for Sunday, June 29, at 9:30 PM at Szot Park.\n*   **Chicopee Pride Festival:** The fifth annual Chicopee Pride Festival is scheduled for Saturday, June 14, 2025, from noon to 5 PM at Szot Park. This free event celebrates the LGBTQ+ community and features entertainment. A Pride Month flag raising event is also held at City Hall Flag Plaza on Friday, June 13, 2025.\n*   **Strawberry Festivals:** The Second Annual Strawberry Festival is planned for Saturday, June 14, 2025, from 12 PM to 5 PM at McKinstry Market Garden. It features craft vendors, live music, farm animals, and food.\n*   **Chicopee Irish Night:** This event, hosted by the Holyoke St. Patrick's Parade Committee, usually takes place in early March. In 2025, it's scheduled for Friday, March 7, at the Portuguese American Club. The committee also announces award recipients for the upcoming Holyoke St. Patrick's Parade in December, with a President's Dinner in February. The Holyoke St. Patrick's Parade itself, which Chicopee participates in, is scheduled for March 23, 2025.\n*   **Faded Barber Lounge Back to School Event:** This community event, focused on schools, is listed on the Chicopee Chamber of Commerce calendar for Sunday, August 24, 2025.\n*   **Hispanic Heritage Dominos Tournament:** Another event listed by the Chicopee Chamber of Commerce, scheduled for Saturday, August 23, 2025.\n*   **Chicopee Chamber of Commerce Events:** Beyond the specific events listed, the Chamber of Commerce calendar is a good resource for community and networking events, such as their 2025 Membership Appreciation event on Wednesday, July 16, 2025.\n*   **Walking Tours:** Various \"Chicopee Walking Tours\" covering themes like \"Arts & Industry\" and \"A Trip to Old Cabotville\" are sometimes offered, providing an opportunity to engage with residents interested in local history and culture.\n\n**General Strategies:**\n\n*   **Community Calendars:** Regularly check the \"City Events Calendar\" on the Chicopee, MA official website, the Chicopee Public Library's event calendar, the Chicopee Chamber of Commerce events calendar, and platforms like Eventbrite and AllEvents for upcoming activities.\n*   **Police Department Community Outreach:** The Chicopee Police Department also lists community outreach events they offer, such as \"Coffee with a Cop\" and \"Trunk or Treat\" (seasonal), which could provide informal opportunities for interaction.\n*   **Local Organizations and Cultural Groups:** Look for events hosted by specific community groups, cultural councils, or local associations that align with your interests and where you might find engaged voters. The Chicopee Cultural Council supports various arts and humanities projects in the community and holds monthly meetings.\n\nBy actively participating in these diverse events, you can connect with a broad range of Chicopee residents and gain a deeper understanding of their concerns and priorities as you campaign for the school board."

While the exact dates for Chicopee's 2025 school board election primaries (if any) and the general election aren't explicitly listed, the information available provides a general framework for mail-in voting in Massachusetts.\n\nHere's what you need to know for the Chicopee, MA School Board election in 2025:\n\n**Mail-in Ballot Application Deadlines:**\n*   Your application for a mail-in ballot must reach your local election officials by 5 p.m. on the 5th business day before the election.\n*   For the General Municipal Election on Tuesday, November 4, 2025, the voter registration deadline is Saturday, October 25, 2025.\n\n**Mail-in Ballot Return Deadlines:**\n*   For most elections in Massachusetts, including municipal elections, your completed mail-in ballot must be received by your local election office or a drop box by 8:00 PM on Election Day to be counted.\n*   The only exception is for the biennial state election in November, where ballots postmarked by Election Day have an additional three days to arrive. However, the school board election would fall under municipal elections, so the Election Day receipt deadline generally applies.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Chicopee Specifics:** While state laws govern much of the mail-in ballot process, the specific dates for Chicopee's school board election (including any potential primary) will be set locally. It is crucial to confirm these dates with the Chicopee Registrar of Voters. You can find their contact information and a calendar of important dates on the City of Chicopee website.\n*   **Receiving an Application:** The state will send a pre-addressed, postage-paid Vote by Mail application to every registered voter before each statewide election, typically 45 days beforehand. For local elections, like a school board election, you may need to proactively request an application.\n*   **Applying for Your Ballot:** You can request your mail-in ballot online, by mail, or by email or fax. You can apply for mail-in ballots for all elections in a calendar year with a single application.\n*   **Tracking Your Ballot:** You can track the status of your mail-in ballot through the state's website. This tool shows when your application was received, when your ballot was mailed, and when your completed ballot was received.\n*   **Voting in Person:** If you apply to vote by mail but your ballot is not received, you can still vote in person on Election Day or at an early voting location. Measures are in place to prevent a ballot from being counted twice."
